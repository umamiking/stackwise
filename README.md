- Check pivot sizes and frame opening measurements
- Components sorted by thickness for easy scanning

### Smart Compatibility Analysis

The tool uses real-world tolerances based on actual swap testing and validates multiple compatibility factors:

#### Thickness Compatibility:
- ✅ **Perfect Fit (Green)** - Within 0.05mm, direct swap with no modifications
- ⚡ **Close Fit (Purple)** - Within 0.3mm in either direction, works with handle compression or expansion (pivot screw tightening/loosening compensates)
- 🔧 **Needs Spacer (Orange)** - Replacement is thinner by 0.3-2mm, includes specific spacer recommendations
- ❌ **Too Thick (Red)** - Replacement is thicker by more than 0.3mm, beyond handle expansion capability
- ❌ **Won't Work (Red)** - Replacement is thinner by more than 2mm, gap too large even with spacers

**Important:** Spacers can only be used when the replacement tool is **thinner** than the original. If the replacement is thicker by more than 0.3mm, the handle cannot expand enough to accommodate it.

#### Pivot Compatibility:
**Critical Requirement:** Tool pivots must match within 0.05mm for components to be swappable. The tool automatically checks pivot sizes and blocks incompatible swaps.

**Pivot Size Groups:**
- **4.69-4.70mm pivot**: Wave+, Rebar, Surge, Wingman, Sidekick, Super Tool 300, Bond
- **3.07mm pivot**: Arc, Free P4, Free P2
- **Different pivot sizes cannot be swapped** - this is a hard physical limitation

When a pivot mismatch is detected, the tool displays:
- ✗ **Pivot Mismatch** badge
- Detailed warning showing source and target pivot sizes
- These swaps are marked as incompatible regardless of thickness

### Intelligent Spacer Recommendations

When a swap requires spacers, the tool automatically:
- Determines which spacer pack applies (5mm or 3.5mm based on model compatibility)
- Calculates optimal spacer combinations (e.g., "2x 0.5mm + 1x 0.1mm")
- Shows exactly which spacers you need from available packs

**Spacer Pack Reference:**
- **5mm Pack** (Wave+, Rebar, Surge, Wingman, Sidekick, Bond, Super Tool 300): 4x 0.1mm, 4x 0.5mm, 5x 1mm
- **3.5mm Pack** (Arc, Free P4, Free P2): 6x 0.1mm, 6x 0.5mm

### Stack Order Data

Models marked with ✓ include detailed stack order information showing:
- Left and right handle component arrangement (top to bottom)
- Washers, springs, and other spacers with measurements (where available)
- External vs internal tool placement
- Notes on tool-specific characteristics
- Measurements displayed in mm with inch references where applicable

## 📊 Data Source

All measurements are sourced from [Zach at MultiParts Store](https://multipartsstore.com) and [ZapWizard](https://zapwizard.com/), who have meticulously documented tool dimensions through precise measurements and real-world testing.

**Example Verified Swaps:**

✅ **Rebar Awl (2.32mm) ↔ Wave+ Scissors (2.53mm)**  
*Difference: +0.21mm (slightly thicker) - Works perfectly! Handle expands slightly, no spacers needed.*  
*Both tools use 4.69mm pivots ✓*

✅ **Any tool → Thinner replacement with spacers**  
*When replacing with a thinner tool (0.3-2mm difference), add appropriate spacers to fill the gap.*

❌ **Example Incompatible Swap: Rebar Phillips (5.04mm, 4.69mm pivot) ✗ Arc Bit Driver (5.04mm, 3.07mm pivot)**  
*Even though thickness matches perfectly, the pivot mismatch makes this swap impossible*

❌ **Rebar Awl (2.32mm) → Wingman Phillips (3.06mm)**  
*Difference: +0.74mm - Too thick! Beyond the 0.3mm expansion tolerance. Cannot add spacers on top of a thicker tool.*

## 🚀 How to Use

### Basic Workflow

**For Component Swaps:**
1. Select "Find Swaps for Component" mode
2. Choose your source tool (the tool you want to modify)
3. Click on the component you want to replace
4. Review all compatible swaps from other models, sorted best to worst
5. Check spacer recommendations if needed

**For Model Comparison:**

## 🔍 Technical Details

### Measurements Included

- **Tool Thickness** - The critical measurement for swap compatibility
- **Frame Opening** - Overall tool width (affects what will fit)
- **Pivot Sizes** - Plier pivot and tool pivot dimensions (REQUIRED for compatibility)
- **Drive Sizes** - Screw types needed for disassembly
- **Stack Order** - Exact arrangement of components within handles (for select models)
- **Spacers & Washers** - Complete spacer data with measurements (where available)

### Display Format

- **Primary measurements**: All displayed in millimeters (mm) for consistency
- **Reference measurements**: Inch measurements shown next to component names when available
- **Example**: "Washer 0.03" (Spacer) → 0.76mm"
- This format maintains consistency while preserving original source data

### Compatibility Validation

The tool performs multi-factor compatibility checking:

1. **Pivot Size Match** (Primary Check)
   - Tool pivots must match within 0.05mm
   - This is checked FIRST as it's a hard physical requirement
   - No amount of spacers can compensate for pivot mismatch

2. **Thickness Compatibility** (Secondary Check)
   - Only evaluated after pivot compatibility is confirmed
   - Uses bidirectional tolerance within 0.3mm (compression or expansion)
   - Beyond 0.3mm: thicker = incompatible, thinner = needs spacers

3. **Spacer Calculation** (When Replacement is Thinner)
   - Automatically determines which spacer pack applies (5mm vs 3.5mm)
   - Calculates optimal spacer combinations
   - Only suggests spacers when replacement is 0.3-2mm thinner than original
   - **Critical**: Spacers cannot be used when replacement is thicker

### Compatibility Philosophy

The tool uses a hierarchical validation system based on real-world testing:

**Primary Requirement: Pivot Compatibility**
- Tool pivots must match within 0.05mm (essentially exact match)
- This is a hard physical constraint - components cannot mount on wrong-sized pivots
- Checked before any thickness analysis

**Secondary Requirement: Thickness Tolerance**
- **0-0.05mm**: Perfect dimensional match
- **0.05-0.3mm**: Handle flex zone (works in BOTH directions - compression when thinner, expansion when slightly thicker)
- **0.3-2mm thinner**: Spacer compensation zone (available spacers can fill the gap when replacement is thinner)
- **>0.3mm thicker**: Beyond handle expansion capability - incompatible
- **>2mm thinner**: Beyond practical spacer range - incompatible

**Spacer Logic:**
- Spacers can **only** be added when the replacement tool is thinner than the original
- When replacement is thicker by >0.3mm, no amount of spacers will help (you'd need to remove material)
- Within 0.3mm thicker, the handle can expand slightly to accommodate

**Important Notes:**
- Wave+ and Rebar tools have different architectures: Wave+ has external integrated tools, while Rebar stores all tools inside the handle stack
- Surge, Wingman, and Sidekick also have external tools (scissors, blades, saw) that sit in handle slots
- Super Tool 300 stores all tools inside the handle stack - large tools (saw, blades, file) are internal and physically touch other tools, unlike Wave+/Surge external tools
- Bond stores all tools inside handles similar to Rebar
- Some tools are "large tools" (files, saws, blades) that typically only swap with other large tools
- Plier heads are excluded from swap recommendations as they are complex assemblies
- Estimated/unknown measurements are marked with ⚠️ warning indicators
